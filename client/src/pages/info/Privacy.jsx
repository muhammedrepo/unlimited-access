            – Website Visitors
            <br /> Like most website operators, CloutZap, BV collects
            non-personally-identifying information of the sort that web browsers
            and servers typically make available, such as the browser type,
            language preference, referring site, and the date and time of each
            visitor request. CloutZap, BV’s purpose in collecting non-personally
            identifying information is to better understand how CloutZap, BV’s
            visitors use its website. From time to time, CloutZap, BV may
            release non-personally-identifying information in the aggregate,
            e.g., by publishing a report on trends in the usage of its website.
            <br /> CloutZap, BV also collects potentially personally-identifying
            information like Internet Protocol (IP) addresses for logged in
            users and for users leaving comments on / blog posts. CloutZap, BV
            only discloses logged in user and commenter IP addresses under the
            same circumstances that it uses and discloses personally-identifying
            information as described below.
          </p>
          <p>
            – Gathering of Personally-Identifying Information
            <br /> Certain visitors to CloutZap, BV’s websites choose to

            information that CloutZap, BV gathers depends on the nature of the
            interaction. For example, we ask visitors who sign up for a blog at
            / to provide a username and email address.

            rooms, forums, interactive features, public-facing member profile,
            third-party social networking services or other communication

            preferences, total rewards earned, profile picture and other profile
            information we believe will help motivate you and others to
            participate in our program may be publicly displayed on the CloutZap
            Sites and Features along with User Content. User Content may also
            contain metadata, which may contain information about or relating to
            you, that we may also collect, share and use.&nbsp;Anything posted
            through Community Features is publicly available.&nbsp; This means
            that others will have access to that User Content and may use it or
            share it with third parties; this is beyond our control. If you
            choose to voluntarily disclose Personal Information in the User
            Content and/or on the Community Features, that information will be
            considered publicly available information as well.&nbsp; The
            protections of this Privacy Policy will not apply to publicly

          <p>Third-Party Links</p>
          <p>
            The CloutZap Sites and Features contain links to other websites and
            other third-party provided goods and services that we do not own,
            operate nor control. In addition, because aspects of the CloutZap
            Sites and Features include third-party Offers for goods, services
            and the like, third parties may collect your information based on
            your interaction with those offers. Third-party privacy practices
            are not covered by this Privacy Policy, and we are not responsible
            for the privacy practices of such third parties. We encourage our
            users to be aware of and to read the privacy statements and similar
            disclosures of any third-party website that collects personally
            identifiable information before using or disclosing any personally
            identifiable information to such website.

          <p>Advertising Networks and Analytics Companies</p>
          <p>
            We may allow other companies, commonly called third-party ad servers
            or advertising networks (collectively, “Ad&nbsp;Networks”), to
            display advertisements on the CloutZap Sites and Features. These
            advertisements may be based on your interests as reflected in your
            use of the CloutZap Sites and Features or our Services, as well as
            your use of other websites and services. Some of these Ad Networks
            may place a persistent cookie or other similar technology on your
            computer, mobile device and other devices you use (collectively,
            “Device(s)”), allowing them to recognize you and/or your Device each
            time they send you an online advertisement.&nbsp; In this way, Ad
            Networks may compile information about where you see their
            advertisements online and determine which ads you click on, so that
            we and they may provide you with Offers believed to be of most
            interest to you. We do not have access to or control over the
            cookies or other similar technologies that may be placed by these
            parties on your Device, nor do we have responsibility for these
            parties’ privacy policies or information collection practices. You
            may limit or remove such cookies and similar technologies through
            your Device settings; for more information, visit our “

            consumer data resellers that buy and/or sell information to other
            companies for multiple purposes including offering products and
            services that may interest you, and we use certain third-party
            analytics providers to help us understand how you use the CloutZap
            Sites and Features or our Services, and these companies may set
            their own cookies and similar technologies on your Device. For
            example, we use Google Analytics to track visitors’ activity on our
            website. Google Analytics and similar third-party analytics
            providers use web browsing data and other data analysis to improve
            their own products. These and other Trusted Service Providers may
            collect information about you, including but not limited to your
            online activities over time and across different websites and
            services, when you use the CloutZap Sites and Features or our
            Services, or other online websites and services. Each of these third
            parties has its own privacy policy that may differ from this Privacy
            Policy.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We may share your Personal Information and
            other information with our Trusted Service Providers for the purpose
            of making it easier for you to sign up for their Offers, validating
            your communications or transactions with them, authenticating and/or
            validating your identification, crediting you with any earned
            rewards, and for our Business Purposes. Additionally, we may share
            information with our Trusted Service Providers to assist us in
            delivering Offers to you, both on the CloutZap Sites and Features
            and elsewhere, and for our Business Purposes.

            “cookies”) on your Device(s), including, without limitation, web
            beacons&nbsp; and embedded scripts.&nbsp;Such cookies may be
            set&nbsp;alone or in combination with other cookies.&nbsp; Such
            third parties may&nbsp;collect information across various channels,
            including offline and online, for purposes of delivering more
            relevant Offers to you.&nbsp;&nbsp;As used herein,&nbsp; cookies are
            a small data file (used on or in connection with the CloutZap Sites
            and Features) which are stored on your systems. We (including our
            Affiliates and Trusted Service Providers) may use a variety of
            cookies in connection with the Business
            Purposes.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cookies automatically capture certain
            information, including, without limitation, your IP Address,
            operating system, screen display settings, browser type, use of
            Flash and Java and they detect whether your Device or software has
            certain capabilities such a microphone or webcam access. Cookies may
            also collect your Personal Information. We and our Trusted Service
            Providers use such information to support the CloutZap Sites and
            Features and to support our Services generally by (i) offering you
            surveys, shopping, and other targeted Offers, (ii) for identity
            verification, (iii) for analytics and (iv) to ensure compliance with
            our programs.&nbsp; Cookies also help us understand or predict your
            interests so we can personalize your experience.&nbsp;Cookies are
            also used as follows:&nbsp;(a) to provide you with convenience when
            you access the CloutZap Sites and Features by remembering that you
            have visited us before and by remembering your username, password
            and other user information, and your preferences to help you avoid
            future re-entry of certain information.&nbsp;(b)&nbsp;to allow us
            and our Trusted Service Providers to customize the layout and tailor
            content shown to you on the CloutZap Sites and Features and
            throughout your online experience across Devices, web browsers,
            email, mobile and other applications. In doing so, we may link the
            information we collect from cookies and (from other sources
            referenced in this Privacy Policy) with your Personal Information
            and we may track your activity (including, without limitation, your
            web-browsing activity) in order to provide you with Offers and for
            Business Purposes.&nbsp;&nbsp;(c)&nbsp;for anonymous and also for
            personally identifiable analytical and statistical purposes, quality
            control, validation and verification purposes,&nbsp; and to improve
            the services we, our Affiliates’ and our Trusted Service Providers’
            Offer.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(d) Our Affiliates and Trusted Service
            Providers may link the information we share with them (or that they
            collect) to the cookie stored on your browser or Device, and they
            may collect information such as your IP address, browser or
            operating system type and version, and demographic or
            inferred-interest information. Our Affiliates and Trusted Service
            Providers use this information to recognize you across different
            channels and platforms, including but not limited to, computers,
            mobile devices, and Smart TVs, over time for advertising, analytics,
            attribution, and reporting purposes. For example, our Trusted
            Service Providers may deliver an advertisement to you in your web
            browser based on a purchase you made in a physical retail store, or
            they may send a personalized marketing email to you based on the
            fact that you visited a particular website. Your data may be
            transferred outside of the country from which it was originally
            collected.&nbsp;&nbsp;(e) Our mobile applications may include
            tracking technologies via software development kits that share your
            device’s precise geolocation and other details about your device
            (like hardware characteristics, a variety of sensor data, and a list
            of installed third-party applications) with our Trusted Service
            Providers who may use all of this information to generate Offers for
            you. For example, third-party tracking technologies may analyze
            restaurant visit trends to better serve customers’ needs or your
            mobile application install history to provide you Offers that may be
            of interest. See instructions to limit or disable such tracking in
            this section below; but be aware that limiting such tracking will
            affect some device or mobile application functionality.&nbsp;We use
            both session cookies and persistent cookies. For the session
            cookies, once you close your browser, the cookie terminates. A
            persistent cookie is a small text file stored on your hard drive for
            an extended period of time. Persistent cookies can be removed or
            disabled by following your web browser help-file directions. We also
            use Flash cookies, which are data files placed on a Device via the
            Adobe Flash plug-in (or other compatible Flash plugin) that may be
            built-in to the CloutZap Sites and Features or downloaded by you.
            Flash cookies may be used for various purposes, including, without
            limitation, enabling a Flash feature and remembering your
            preferences. We do not use Flash cookies nor locally-shared objects
            in connection with CloutZap’s own ad effectiveness research
            activities.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Most web

          <p>Notification of Changes</p>
          <p>
            We reserve the right to make changes to this Privacy Policy from
            time to time. If we decide to change this Privacy Policy, we will
            provide notice of such changes by sending you an administrative
            email and/or posting those changes in places on the CloutZap Sites
            and Features deemed appropriate by us so our users are always aware
            of what information we collect, how we use it, and under what
            circumstances it may be shared with others. Your continued use of
            any of the CloutZap Sites and Features or our Services after
            delivery of the administrative email to you or after the changes are
            posted constitutes your agreement to the changes. If you do not
            agree to the changes, please discontinue your use of such CloutZap
            Sites and Features and our Services. To the extent that an
            arbitrator or court of applicable jurisdiction determines that
            applying any changes to this Privacy Policy to any prior events or
            circumstances would render this an illusory or unenforceable
            contract, such changes shall be applicable on a prospective basis
            only, with respect to events or circumstances occurring after the
            date of such changes, to the extent necessary to avoid this Privacy
            Policy being deemed illusory or unenforceable. In any event, if any
            Personal Information was previously submitted to or collected by us
            pursuant to an earlier version of this Privacy Policy that required
            a certain notice period prior to any changes being effective, any
            changes under this Privacy Policy will not be effective as to you or
            such previously-collected Personal Information until the
            previously-specified notice period has passed after the date of this
            Privacy Policy.

          <p>Children’s Privacy</p>
          <p>
            The CloutZap Sites and Features and our Services are for general
            audiences and we do not knowingly collect any Personal Information
            from children younger than the age of 13. If you are under 18, you
            should use the CloutZap Sites and Features and our Services only
            with the permission&nbsp;and guidance&nbsp;of your parent or
            guardian. If you are under 13, you should not submit any Personal
            Information to us. If we learn that we have inadvertently collected
            Personal Information from a child younger than 13, we will take
            commercially reasonable efforts to delete such Personal Information
            from our databases.&nbsp;&nbsp;If a California resident is known to
            us to be between 13 and 15 years of age, we will use reasonable
            efforts to promptly request that such consumer provide their
            expressed opt-in consent to the sale of their Personal Information
            in order to continue to use the CloutZap Sites and Features, in
            accordance with the CCPA and applicable regulations thereunder.

          <p>Security</p>

            We maintain security measures in place to help protect against the
            loss, misuse and alteration of the Personal Information under our
            control. Please be advised, however, that the Internet and other
            technologies and communication channels are, by their nature, not
            entirely secure, and your information may therefore be subject to
            interception or loss which is beyond our reasonable control. While
            we strive to protect your Personal Information, we cannot ensure or
            warrant the security of any Personal Information you transmit to us,
            and any transmission is done at your own risk. Accordingly, we
            assume no responsibility or liability for disclosure of your
            Personal Information or other information due to errors in
            transmission, unauthorized third-party access or other causes beyond
            our reasonable control.

          <p>
            Although we generally maintain our user data in the United States,
            it is possible that some of the data processing may occur outside of
            the United States, carried out by companies or individuals under
            contract with us. While the data protection laws of these countries
            may vary, we will make every reasonable effort to protect your
            Personal Information under this Privacy Policy. By using the
            CloutZap Sites and Features and our Services, you consent to this
            transfer of your personal data to any server used by the Company or
            its service providers from time to time.&nbsp;If you are not a
            resident of the United States or Canada, please consult the
            international version of our Privacy Policy
            (https://www.CloutZap.com/privacy-policy-intl/) and be aware that
            data protection laws in the United States and Canada (as well as the
            legal procedures for courts, governmental authorities, and parties
            in civil litigation to obtain access to our user data) may differ
            substantially from the laws and procedures in your country of
            residence.&nbsp;If you are located in a country outside the United
            States and Canada and submit Personal Information to us, you are
            consenting to the transfer, processing, storage and use of that
            information in the United States as provided in this Privacy
            Policy.&nbsp;The interpretation and application of this Privacy
            Policy shall be governed by the laws of the United States and the
            State of California without regard to its conflict of law
            provisions. Your use of the CloutZap Sites and Features or our
            Services are not intended to subject us to the laws or jurisdiction
            of any state, country or territory other than that of the United
            States.

            to a business, they have the right under California Civil Code
            Section 1798.83 to request certain disclosures if that business
            shares that Personal Information with third parties, and in some
            cases affiliates, for the third parties’ or affiliates’ direct
            marketing purposes. Once per calendar year California residents may
            request that the business provide a list of companies with which it
            shares such Personal Information for the third parties’ or
            affiliates’ direct marketing purposes, and a list of the categories
            of such Personal Information that the business shares.&nbsp;
            California residents may request further information about our
            compliance with this law by emailing&nbsp; Please include
            “California Privacy Rights Request” in the first line of the
            description and your California mailing or street address. Please
            note that we are only required to respond to one request per
            customer each year, and we are not required to respond to requests

            2020, California residents also have the following rights provided
            to them under the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018, Civil

            the Sale of Personal Information. California residents have the
            right to opt-out of the sale of their Personal Information. Under
            the CCPA, the “sale” of Personal Information broadly includes any
            communication of Personal Information to any business that is deemed
            to be a “third party” (as defined in the CCPA) for monetary or other
            valuable consideration, subject to certain exceptions and
            limitations.&nbsp; For more information, please consult our Notice
            of Right to Opt Out of the Sale of Info .&nbsp;(4)&nbsp;Authorized
            Agent.&nbsp; California residents may&nbsp;use an authorized agent

            behalf.&nbsp; The authorized agent’s exercise or request on your
            behalf sent by mail shall include a power of attorney or a notarized
            statement properly signed by you appointing such authorized agent
            for such purpose.&nbsp; If your authorized agent submits the
            exercise or request online via the link below, a copy of the power
            of attorney or the original notarized statement shall be mailed to
            the&nbsp;following address: CloutZap, LLC, P.O. Box 70, Manhattan
            Beach, CA 90267; Attention: Privacy,&nbsp;within five (5) days after

            otherwise verify the agent’s authority to our reasonable
            satisfaction.&nbsp;&nbsp;(5)&nbsp;Notice of Financial Incentive.

            Information.&nbsp;(6)&nbsp;Right to Non-Discrimination for the
            Exercise of a Consumer’s Privacy Rights. California residents have a
            right not to receive discriminatory treatment by a business in the
            event that the California resident exercises one or more of their
            privacy rights conferred by the CCPA.&nbsp;(7)&nbsp;How to Submit
