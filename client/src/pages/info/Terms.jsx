            </li>
          </ul>

          <ul>
            <li>
              Search the Internet: The Software allows you to access the
              CloutZap search engine. In addition to customary search engine
              functionality, users of the CloutZap search engine have the value
              added opportunity to randomly earn SB for searching the Internet.
              The Software also gives you the ability to change your web
              browser’s default search engine should you decide to do so. The
              Software may change the homepage on your browser to
              www.CloutZap.com (with your consent). The Software may also inform
              you of reward earning opportunities.

          </ul>

          <ul>
            <li>
              In-Browser Notifications: Installing the Software gives us the
              ability to provide you with various in-browser notifications. The
              most common such opportunities are notices regarding available
              Codes and CloutZap earning opportunities in relation to
              third-party goods and services providers.
            </li>
          </ul>

            <li>
              eCommerce: When visiting a website of a third-party goods or
              services provider, the CloutZap will either create a tracking
              ticket and start a rewards shopping session or visually prompt you
              to press a button to start your rewards shopping session. You are
              likely to receive some form of in-browser notice advising you of a
              CloutZap earning opportunity related to the third-party
              goods/services provider. If you start a shopping session using the
              CloutZap, it will set a cookie on your device through an affiliate
              network for the purpose of tracking your shopping session and
              crediting your reward – similar to the way your shopping
              experience would work if initiated via the shopping portal on
              CloutZap.com. Please note, however, that if cookies or other
              similar tracking devices from other affiliate marketing companies
              are already present on your computer, the Software will not
              automatically overwrite those cookies, but the CloutZap may still
              offer you the ability to start a CloutZap earning shopping session
              when you have arrived at a participating merchant’s website. Our
              use of cookies is more specifically described in our&nbsp;

                <p>
                  Overview
                  <br /> The Company may offer one or more affiliate programs
                  (“Affiliate Programs”) under which you may have the
                  opportunity to earn money (in the CloutZap.com program). Not
                  all of the CloutZap Sites and Features offer Affiliate Rewards
                  Programs, however, and Affiliate Programs may include
                  Additional Terms that apply to your participation in
                  activities allowing you to earn money (collectively,
                  “Activities”). The Company may limit, suspend or terminate
                  your ability to participate in a Affiliate Program in its sole
                  and absolute discretion, and may void any money, points,
                  rewards, or potential rewards you may have earned or
                  accumulated in an Affiliate Program, if we determine in our
                  sole discretion that you have not complied with these Terms or
                  any Additional Terms applicable to such participation. For
                  example, fraudulent traffic (“fake clicks and fake referrals”)
                  is not tolerated.&nbsp;If we determine in our sole discretion
                  that your account contains fraudulent traffic, we will void
                  any money, points, rewards, or potential rewards you have
                  earned and we will terminate your account. And if a payment
                  has already been made to you, we will allow thirty (30) days
                  for you to refund it or we will take legal action.&nbsp;You
                  agree to abide by the final and binding decisions of the
                  Company regarding any Rewards Program and your participation
                  in it. We reserve the right to change, suspend, or cancel all
                  or a portion of a Affiliate Program, including any points you
                  may have accrued, at any time without prior notice to you.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Earning Points
                  <br /> Points can be earned in a Rewards Program by
                  participating in certain Activities, as described in the
                  applicable CloutZap Sites and Features. If you choose to
                  participate and follow the instructions associated with an
                  Activity, upon satisfying all of the requirements of the
                  Activity, you will be awarded the points associated with
                  completing that Activity so long as the Company and/or its
                  third-party Rewards Program affiliates are able to properly
                  track your valid and completed point-earning Activities. For
                  avoidance of doubt, Company shall not be responsible for, nor
                  shall Company be obligated to award points or rewards to
                  Rewards Program participants for, any Activity that is not
                  properly recorded, tracked and/or deemed approved under
                  Company’s or its third-party Rewards Program affiliates’
                  policies, procedures and systems. There may be limitations on
                  Activities and rewards, so please be sure to review all
                  applicable Additional Terms before deciding whether or not you
                  would like to participate. For example, we reserve the right
                  to request and verify receipts of completed purchases prior to
                  or in connection with the awarding of points for shopping
                  Activities in order to verify with the applicable merchant
                  that such purchases are valid. Some of the limitations on
                  Activities and rewards include (without limitation), our right
                  to change or limit your ability to participate in certain
                  Activities or the Rewards Program itself; our right to change
                  or limit the allowable frequency of Activities; our right to
                  change or limit the number of points you can earn for a given
                  Activity or during a given time period; and our right to
                  change the Activities or rewards available, or the number of
                  points required for a particular reward. Points awarded have
                  no cash value.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Redeeming Points
                  <br /> You may redeem points you have earned for rewards
                  offered in a Rewards Program pursuant to these Terms and any
                  applicable Additional Terms. Supplies may be limited. Rewards
                  may be awarded on a first-come, first-serve and
                  while-supplies-last basis. If you attempt to redeem points for
                  a reward and the Company determines that the reward is
                  unavailable, out of stock, or for whatever reason cannot be
                  provided to you, the Company may, at its sole and absolute
                  discretion, provide you with a reward of equal or greater
                  value. No credit, reversal, or refund of points will be issued
                  for any reason after points have been redeemed; in other
                  words, once you order a reward, you may not cancel the reward
                  or return the reward for a refund of points. The only way to
                  use points is to redeem them for Rewards Program rewards as
                  available from time to time through the CloutZap.com Rewards
                  Store at&nbsp;
                  <Link to='https://cloutzap.com/home'>/dashboard</Link>, or
                  other applicable Rewards Program redemption sites, as
                  applicable. Some rewards may have eligibility requirements and
                  in that case the Company reserves the right to verify your
                  identity (by requesting photocopy of your driver’s license or
                  state ID card, or other proof as we may require) and
                  eligibility qualifications to our complete satisfaction prior
                  to crediting points or fulfilling any reward in any Rewards
                  Program, or otherwise providing you with any benefit.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Delivery of Rewards
                  <br /> Rewards may be emailed to your email address or mailed
                  to the U.S. postal address, as applicable, that you provided
                  when you registered and created an account (“Account”) for the
                  applicable Rewards Program, or to the email or U.S. postal
                  address that our records show your Account was last updated to
                  reflect. Processing times may vary. Rewards that are
                  undeliverable or unclaimed for whatever reason (including,
                  without limitation, because your Account information is
                  incorrect or outdated) may be forfeited, and the points will
                  not be refunded.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Rewards Program Points Nontransferable
                  <br /> Rewards Program points are nontransferable, may not be
                  bartered or sold, and are void if a transfer is attempted, and
                  such points and the associated Account are not transferable
                  upon death, as part of a domestic relations matter or
                  otherwise by operation of law.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Inactive Accounts
                  <br /> Any Account that has not been logged into and points
                  either earned or redeemed for one year or more may be deemed
                  inactive and the Account closed. In such instances, to request
                  Account reactivation (subject to such terms, limitations and
                  requirements as we may impose from time to time) you may reach
                  us by using the “Contact Us”, “Contact Member Services” or
                  similar contact link in the footer of any of the CloutZap
                  Sites. We may modify our inactive Account rules and policies
                  in our Rewards Programs from time to time, and if your Account
                  becomes inactive pursuant to such then-current rules or
                  policies, we may close your Account, without any compensation
                  or further obligation to you.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Points Expiration
                  <br /> Any points in our Rewards Programs that have not been
                  redeemed for two (2) years from the time such points were
                  earned or awarded may be deemed expired and removed from your
                  Account. For existing members of any Rewards Program on July
                  1, 2016, the foregoing 2-year period shall run from that date
                  with respect to any points in your Account on such date. In
                  such instances, to request re-crediting of the expired points
                  to the Account (subject to such terms, limitations and
                  requirements as we may impose from time to time) you can reach
                  us by using the “Contact Us”, “Contact Member Services” or
                  similar contact link in the footer of any of the CloutZap
                  Sites. We may modify our points expiration rules and policies
                  for any points in our Rewards Programs from time to time, and
                  if your points expire pursuant to such then-current rules or
                  policies, we may remove such points from your Account, without
                  any compensation or further obligation to you regarding the
                  expired points.

                                  thirty (30) days after our receipt of your
                                  Notice, you may commence an arbitration
                                  proceeding by sending an arbitration demand
                                  (“Arbitration Demand”) to the following
                                  address: CloutZap Dispute Resolution,
                                  CloutZap, PTY, Amsterdam, Noord-Holland,
                                  Attention: Legal Department. The parties agree
                                  to arbitrate any Dispute or Claim between
                                  them, except to the extent either party
                                  chooses to instead pursue the Dispute or Claim
                                  in small claims court as provided below.
                                  Arbitration is more informal than a lawsuit in
                                  court. Arbitration uses a neutral arbitrator
                                  instead of a judge or jury, allows for more
                                  limited discovery than in court, and is
                                  subject to very limited review by courts.
                                  Arbitrators generally can award the same
                                  damages and relief that a court can award.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                  Except as otherwise provided herein, upon
                                  either party filing an Arbitration Demand, we
                                  will pay all filing, administration, and
                                  arbitrator fees, unless your Dispute or Claim
                                  exceeds $75,000 (exclusive of any filing,
                                  administration, arbitrator, or attorneys’ fees
                                  or other fees or expenses). If you initiate an
                                  arbitration in which you seek more than
                                  $75,000 (exclusive of any filing,
                                  administration, arbitrator, or attorneys’ fees
                                  or other fees or expenses) in damages, the
                                  American Arbitration Association’s (“AAA”)
                                  Commercial Arbitration Rules and the
                                  Supplementary Procedures for Consumer-Related
                                  Disputes (collectively, the “AAA Rules”) will
                                  govern the payment of these fees. The AAA
                                  Rules, as modified by these Rules, will govern
                                  the arbitration. The AAA Rules are available
                                  online at www.adr.org, or by calling the AAA
                                  at 1-800-778-7879. If your Dispute or Claim is
                                  for $10,000 or less (exclusive of any filing,
                                  administration, arbitrator, or attorneys’ fees
                                  or other fees or expenses), we agree that you
                                  may choose whether the arbitration will be
                                  conducted solely on the basis of documents
                                  submitted to the arbitrator, through a
                                  telephonic hearing, or by an in-person hearing
                                  under the AAA Rules. If your Dispute or Claim
                                  exceeds $10,000 (exclusive of any filing,
                                  administration, arbitrator, or attorneys’ fees
                                  or other fees or expenses), the right to a
                                  hearing will be determined by the AAA Rules.
                                  Furthermore, if AAA at the time the
                                  arbitration is filed has Minimum Standards of

                                  in effect which would be applicable to the
                                  matter in dispute, the Company agrees to
                                  provide the benefit of such Minimum Standards
                                  to you to the extent they are more favorable
                                  than the comparable arbitration provisions set
                                  forth in this arbitration provision, provided,
                                  however, that in no event may such Minimum
                                  Standards contravene or restrict the

                                  Unless the parties agree otherwise in writing,
                                  any arbitration hearings will take place in
                                  the county (or parish) in which you reside
                                  (except that, if you reside outside of the
                                  United States, any such hearings will take
                                  place in Los Angeles County, California). One
                                  arbitrator, who is selected under the AAA
                                  Rules and who has expertise in consumer
                                  disputes in the Internet industry, will
                                  conduct the arbitration. If no arbitrator
                                  possessing such expertise is available, then
                                  the arbitration will be conducted by a single
                                  arbitrator who is selected by the mutual
                                  written approval of the parties. Except as
                                  allowed under applicable law and the AAA
                                  Rules, the decisions of the arbitrator will be
                                  binding and conclusive on all parties.
                                  Judgment upon any award of the arbitrator may
                                  be entered by any court of competent
                                  jurisdiction. This provision will be
                                  specifically enforceable in any court. THE
                                  ARBITRATOR MUST FOLLOW THESE RULES AND CAN
                                  AWARD THE SAME DAMAGES AND RELIEF AS A COURT
                                  (INCLUDING ATTORNEYS’ FEES).

                                <p>
                                  All issues are for the arbitrator to decide,
                                  except that issues relating to the scope and
                                  enforceability of the arbitration provision
                                  are for a court to decide. Regardless of the
                                  manner in which the arbitration is conducted,
                                  the arbitrator shall issue a reasoned written
                                  decision sufficient to explain the essential
                                  findings and conclusions on which the award is
                                  based. Except as otherwise provided herein, we
                                  will pay all filing, administration, and
                                  arbitrator fees for any arbitration initiated
                                  in accordance with the notice requirements
                                  above. If, however, the arbitrator finds that
                                  either the substance of your Dispute or Claim
                                  or the relief sought is frivolous or brought
                                  for an improper purpose (as measured by the
                                  standards set forth in Federal Rule of Civil
                                  Procedure 11(b)), then the payment of all such
                                  fees will be governed by the AAA Rules. Also,
                                  if you initiate an arbitration in which you
                                  seek more than $75,000 in damages, the payment
                                  of fees will be governed by the AAA Rules.

                                  We may make a written settlement offer to you
                                  before the arbitrator issues an award. If,
                                  after the arbitrator finds in your favor on
                                  the merits of the claim, and the arbitrator
                                  issues you an award that is greater than our
                                  written offer, we will: (1) pay you the
                                  greater of the amount of the award or $7,500
                                  (“Alternative Payment”); and (2) pay your
                                  attorney, if you use an attorney, twice the
                                  amount of any reasonable attorneys’ fees
                                  awarded by the arbitrator, and reimburse any
                                  expenses that your attorney reasonably accrues
                                  for investigating, preparing, and pursuing
                                  your arbitration claim (“Attorney Fee
                                  Premium”). The Attorney Fee Premium does not
                                  supplant any right you may have to reasonable
                                  attorneys’ fees under applicable law. Thus, if
                                  you would be entitled to a greater amount
                                  under applicable law, the Attorney Fee Premium
                                  does not preclude the arbitrator from awarding
                                  you that amount. You may not, however, recover
                                  duplicative attorneys’ fees or costs. If we do
                                  not make a written settlement offer to you
                                  before the arbitrator issues an award, you and
                                  your attorney will be entitled to the
                                  Alternative Payment and the Attorney Fee
                                  Premium, respectively, if the arbitrator
                                  decides in your favor on the merits. We agree
                                  that we will not seek any award of attorneys’
                                  fees, even if we are entitled to such fees.
                                  The arbitrator may make any determinations and
                                  resolve any Dispute or Claim as to the payment
                                  and reimbursement of fees, the Alternative
                                  Payment, or the Attorney Fee Premium at any
                                  time during the proceeding and within fourteen
                                  (14) days after the arbitrator’s final ruling
                                  on the merits. The arbitrator may award
                                  declaratory or injunctive relief only in favor
                                  of the individual party seeking relief and
                                  only to the extent necessary to provide relief
                                  warranted by that party’s individual claim.
                                  Furthermore, these arbitration provisions
                                  shall not prevent any party from seeking
                                  provisional remedies in aid of arbitration
                                  from a court of appropriate jurisdiction.

                                  arises or may arise before or after the

                                  future material change, you are agreeing to
                                  arbitrate in accordance with the language of

                                  extent that an arbitrator or court of
                                  applicable jurisdiction determines that
                                  applying any changes to this arbitration

                                  this an illusory or unenforceable contract or

                                  changes shall be applicable on a prospective

                                  circumstances occurring after the effective
                                  date of such changes, and in that case any

                                  events or circumstances shall be arbitrated in

                                  to avoid these Terms being deemed illusory or
                                  unenforceable.
